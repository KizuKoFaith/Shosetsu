    "synopsis":"The Republic of San Magnolia.\n\nFor a long time this country was attacked by it’s neighbor, the Empire, which created a series of unmanned military vehicles called the Legion. In response to the threat, the Republic successfully completes the development of similar technology and reflects the enemy’s attack, having managed to do without casualties. But this is… the official version. In fact, there were victims. Outside of the 85 districts of the Republic there was actually another one. “The non-existent 86th district.” It was there that battles continued day and night in which young men and women from the detachment known as Eighty-Six participated—they fought in drones…\n\nShinn is the leader of a squadron of eighty-sixers. Lena is a “handler” who commands the detachment from the remote rear with the help of special communication technology.\n\nThe farewell story of the severe and sad struggle of these two begins!"
