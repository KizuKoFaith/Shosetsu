    "synopsis":"After a thrilling summer, autumn is right around the corner, and with it comes the next big event: the school festival.\n\nNatsuki Haibara’s vacation ended with a confession from Hikari, his longtime crush. It should’ve been an easy yes and another goal crossed off his time leap bucket list, but Uta also holds a special place in his heart, throwing his emotions into chaos. His worries seem endless. What if dating one girl ruins his friendship with the other? Or what if it affects the whole group? To add to the chaos, Serika, the school’s music buff, recruits Natsuki into her band. Will the power of music give him the courage he needs to quit stalling and make a decision?"
