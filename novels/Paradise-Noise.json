    "synopsis":"I can still feel the sound of the music that played in that place, on that day.\n\nOn a whim, I uploaded a music video where I wore women’s clothes, but I unexpectedly became famous as a mysterious, high school girl net-musician (despite being a guy). I didn’t think I would be found out since my face wasn’t shown, but my high school music teacher – Hanazono Misao – discovered my secret and used that information to blackmail me.\n\nAnd then, thanks to the three girls I met through Hanazono-sensei – the mad genius pianist Rinko, the flower-arranging princess drummer Shizuki, and the truant zashiki-warashi vocalist Akane – my bland and quiet grey high school life became full of colorful noise and trouble.\n\nA boy-meets-girls story, filled with love, youth, and band!"
