But can you really call an impromptu lunch date, hypnosis chaos, and vigorous study sessions “downtime”? Either way, it draws to a close when Masachika suddenly gets sick. It’s an opportunity for Alya to play nurse…but it’s also a chance for Yuki to execute a sneak attack! As the semester comes to an end, Yuki and Masachika are going to ramp up their sibling rivalry!"
