    "synopsis":"Good grief. After spending years traveling across the world, saving towns, defeating demons, and then finally killing the demon king, my party—the people I considered comrades—decided to kick me out. I’d honestly thought that they’d be different. They wouldn’t be like the rest of the world, who irrationally hate people like me, with Amber Eyes. But…I was wrong.\n\nIn the end, it’s not their fault, though. It’s just how the world was back then. I was sure that with more time and understanding, the world would shed their preconceived notions about those with Amber Eyes and treat us as they would anyone else. I held on to this hope as I used my unique magecraft to reincarnate myself two hundred years into the future. Now, it’s time to find out if my guess was right!"
